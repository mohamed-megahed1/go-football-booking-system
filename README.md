# go-football-booking-system
The "Go Football Booking System" is a project aimed at providing an online platform for booking football playgrounds. It is built using Spring Boot and includes several features for managing bookings, user authentication, and playground information. The system allows both customers and owners to interact with the platform, where customers can book playgrounds and owners can manage their playgrounds and bookings. The project includes various entities such as `Customer`, `Owner`, `PlayGround`, and `BookingDetails`, and implements JWT for authentication.
